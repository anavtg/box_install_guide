* GSM or LoRa antenna cable
* Double-sided high performance adhesive tape
* Technical documentation of equipment
* Technical documentation of IoT sensors
* Schematic of the communication network(s) of the BMS

=== Computer access to the Wattsense console

* Each customer has a dedicated space on the Wattsense User Console at https://console.wattsense.com. This interface allows them to manage their fleet of Boxes.
* A Box must have been activated in advance before it can be fully installed and configured.
* If the Box hasn’t been activated, ask the administrator of the account to create an "installation" access on the Wattsense user console and retrieve the login information (email address and password).
* Once on-site, activate the Box on the console:
** How to Log in to the console: enter the email and password provided by the administrator and click on "Log in".
** Enter the alphanumeric identifier of the Box in the search rectangle at the top.
** Click on "Activate".
** It is required to give the Box a name in the "Name" field (for example, the name of the site where it will be installed).
** If necessary, add additional information in the "Description" field in order to clearly identify the Box (for example the floor or the precise place of installation if on the same site there are several Boxes).
** Click on "Activate the Box".
* You will then be able to access the configuration tools.

== The power supply of the Box

Make sure that the Box has been activated beforehand on the user console.

* Ideally, place the Box in an electrical enclosure or cabinet.
* Attach the Box:
** Mount the Box on a DIN rail.
+
image::images/box_install_din_rail.png[{twothird-width}]

** Or attach 2 screws to a wall and hook the Box using the notches on the back of the case: Screws of maximum 4 mm in diameter, with a head of maximum 7.5 mm diameter, a spacing of 89.4 mm.
+
image::images/box_install_wall_mount.png[{twothird-width}]

* Use a DC power supply of 12V to 24V, 2A.
* Screw the cable into the power connector of the Box.
+
image::images/box_power_connector_wiring.png[{twothird-width}]

* Connect the cable to the power supply.
+
image:images/box_v1_2/2.box_power_full_wiring.png[{twothird-width}]

* Check that the "Power" LED is lit (steady green light).
+
image::images/box_v1_2/5.box_power_led_on.png{half-width}]

* Wait for ten seconds: the "Heartbeat" LED flashes (green light).
+
image::images/box_v1_2/6.box_heartbeat_blink.png{half-width}]

* Wait for the GSM LED to flash; if the LED does not flash after a few minutes, see the GSM Antenna chapter.
+
image::images/box_v1_2/26.box_gsm_led_blink.png[{half-width}]

* Check that the Box appears on the console: the presence indicator of the Box changes from red to green.
* If the Box appears on the console, it is functional; you can go to the connection step of the Box to the equipment and/or the network of the building.
* If the Box does not appear on the console, see the GSM Antenna chapter.

== GSM Antenna

The Box is supplied with a standard GSM antenna.

* If the quality of the GSM signal is good: keep the original antenna installed on the Box.
+
image::images/box_v1_2/7.box_gsm_antenna.png[{small}]

* If the signal quality is insufficient: move the original antenna out of the cabinet; use an RF extension cord with SMA connector, up to 2 meters, + 1 adhesive support to hold the antenna.
* If the signal quality is still insufficient: use a high-gain antenna with a maximum of 10 meters of cable; this antenna can, for example, be moved to the outside or to the other floors to obtain a better signal quality. Please note that, beyond 15 meters of cable, the GSM signal is significantly weakened.

== To connect the Box to the BMS 

* Determine the type(s) of network(s) associated with the BMS (communication protocols between the BMS server and the technical equipment).
* Obtain, if possible, the schematic of the communication network(s) of the BMS.
* Identify where and how the BMS server connects to the building's network. 
+
image::images/bms-diagram-withtext-en.png[{twothird-width}]

=== In case of IP network (Except LON)

Connection: 

* Make sure to have an Ethernet cable
* Connect the cable to the Ethernet port of the Box ETH1 or ETH2. 
+
image::images/box_v1_2/12.box_ip_eth_plug.png{half-width}]

* Connect the Box to the switch (IP network) on which the supervision PC/BMS server is connected.
* Check that the ETH1 or ETH2 LED lights up.
+
image::images/box_v1_2/25.box_ip_both_eth_led_on.png[{half-width}]

Configuration:

* If there is not a DHCP server on the network, attribute a static IP address, its mask and the gateway if necessary to the Box (Discuss with the building’s IT manager).
* If there is a DHCP server on the network, the address is automatically assigned.

Information to retrieve in preparation for the configuration:

* For each device that communicates in Modbus IP 
** From the BMS software, perform an extract of the available properties: list the data types provided by the different devices to which the BMS has access.
** If it is impossible to retrieve this information, recuperate the IP address and TCP port (and if needed, for some devices, the slave address (Slave ID), the brand, and model of the equipment, and extra identifying information. This information is necessary for the installation configuration and to retrieve data.
* In the case of a BACnet IP network
** Write down the BACnet port of the network. This information will be necessary for the installation configuration and to retrieve data.

=== In case of LON IP-852 network 

Connection:

* Make sure to have an Ethernet cable.
* Connect the cable to the Ethernet ports of the Box ETH1 or ETH2.
+
image::images/box_v1_2/12.box_ip_eth_plug.png[{half-width}]

* Connect the other end of the cable to the IP-852 server on the LON network.
+
image::images/lon_ip_gateway_network.png[{twothird-width}]

* Verify that the ETH1 or ETH2 LED lights up
+
image::images/box_v1_2/25.box_ip_both_eth_led_on.png[{half-width}]

* Register the IP address of the Box on the IP-852 server of the LON network; the IP-852 server’s password is probably required.

Information to retrieve in preparation for the configuration:

* Write down the neuron-ID, brand and model of the equipment, and any identifying information. This information will be necessary for the installation configuration and to retrieve data.
* If you have the NL220 software, export the LON database as an archive file or as an NLC file.

Connection: 

* Make sure to have a USB Echelon U60 FT DIN gateway. 
+
image::images/lon_ft10_echelon_u60.png[{half-width}]

+
image::images/lon_ft10_echelon_gateway.png[{half-width}]

* Connect also this gateway to the LON FT10 network. 
+
image::images/box_v1_2/9.lon_ft10_echelon_gateway.png[{twothird-width}]

Information to get  in preparation for the configuration:

Organization of the Bus architecture:

* Gather the necessary information for each device: Bus speed, character size, parity bit, stop bit (from the user console's configuration wizard, get the manufacturer's technical documentation, or directly from the control panels of the equipment).
* The goal is to create a maximum of 2 networks, each grouping equipment with the same communication configuration and assign them to the 2 RS485 ports of the Box.
* If the characteristics of the equipment need to constitute more than 2 homogeneous networks, it is necessary to order another Box.
